    <h1>Laboratory Three</h1>
    <h2>Presenting Content With Style</h2>
    <p>
        Every mad scientist needs to have a few basics on the shelf just to get started:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>A Laboratory - Check. You&#39;re in one right now.</li>
        <li>Content - Check. The HTML in this document will do nicely.</li>
        <li>Style Points - Well... <strong>That is today&#39;s mission!</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <h2> The Power of Presentation </h2>
    <p>
        A webpage without CSS is like wine without a wine glass. Sure, it&#39;s still wine, and it&#39;s still possible for you to consume it, but it&#39;s so much more enjoyable to consume it with <strong>style</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This lab is a technical one, so our focus is going to be on <strong>how</strong> to use the technology of CSS to display the elements of a webpage. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. They&#39;re called a style sheets because they are documents that contain instructions for the stylistic presentation of the HTML. They&#39;re said to be &quot;cascading&quot; because of the way the styling rules &quot;cascade&quot; according to a priority schedule to all the elements in the HTML.</p>
    <p>
        For Lab 3, the HTML content is this page itself. Your job is to create the CSS. The styling requirements are given in the bulleted list below...
    </p>
    <h2> Cascading Style Sheets </h2>
    <p>
        Browse through some pages at <a rel="noopener" href="http://www.montana.edu/">Montana State University</a> for an example of consistent styling. Notice that there is a coherent look and feel from one page to the next. MSU has a carefully branded image, and by using CSS for their online presense, they can efficiently project that image across their entire website with their chosen colors, fonts, and other stylistic treatments.
    </p>
    <h2> Requirements and Grading </h2>
    <p>
        To get started with this lab, you will need to download the content and put it into the correct subfolders, which you will create. The two subfolders will be called css and images. The content you need to dowload is available on the Assigments page of D2L: specimens.png, laboratorywallpaper.jpg, and main.css.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following requirements should all be accomplished by modifying the main.css stylesheet. Make sure you it exists in a folder called css, which should be in the same folder as your index.html file and your images folder. <strong>Do not modify the index.html document.</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 point:<br /> All level 1 header text, &lt;h1&gt;, should appear as sans-serif at 50 pixels high and have a background color of rgb(60,40,30). The text in the header 1 element should also be centered.</li>

        <li>1 point:<br /> All level 2 header text, &lt;h2&gt;, should appear as serif text that is 30 pixels high. The text should be dark red, italicized, styled in the small-caps font variant, and have a 3 pixel spacing between each character.</li>

        <li>1 point:<br /> The specimens.png image should be centered and have a 10 pixel solid border that matches the header 1 background color. Make sure to store it in the /images directory so it shows up!</li>

        <li>1 point:<br /> The labratorywallpaper.png background image should be tiled to take up the whole page. Rename this image labBkgd.png and store it in the images subdirectory.</li>

        <li>1 point:<br /> The spacing between each bullet item in a list is 10 pixels.</li>

        <li>1 point:<br /> All paragraph text, &lt;p&gt;, and text in a list has a background color of #f0f0ef so that the text won&#39;t get lost in the busy background pattern.</li>

        <li>1 point:<br /> When the cursor is placed above a hypertext link, the text of the link should turn white, be in all uppercase letters, should not be underlined, and should have a background color of dark blue.</li>

        <li>1 point:<br /> Any text that is strong, &lt;strong&gt;, in the original html document should be dark red in color, and rendered in a italic serif font.</li>

        <li>1 point:<br /> The main.css file validates.</li>

        <li>1 point:<br /> The expected directory structure is correct.</li>
    </ul>
